You can still create Web pages on your own computer and look at them with
your computer's Web browser, but for other people to see them, you have to
upload them to the "big" computer that has the Web browser.  The rest of
this document is about how to create your first Web page.

<h3 id="basics">1. Creating a Web Page</h3>

This page was typed by hand.  Anybody can do this, you don't need any
special "web creation" tools or HTML editors, and the pages you make can be
viewed from any browser.  To see how this page was made, choose
<b>View Source</b> (or View Page Source, or View Document Source) in your
browser's menu (or &mdash; in at least Chrome and Firefox &mdash; Ctrl-U on
your keyboard).  A simple web page like this one is just plain text with
HTML commands (markup) mixed in.  HTML commands (properly called "tags")
themselves are plain text.

When you're just learning and want to experiment, you can do everything on
your PC.  Create a new directory ("folder") for your website, and then put
the web-page files (HTML plus any pictures) in it.  Use NotePad or other
plain-text editor (not word processor) on your PC to create your "home page",
a file named
<span class="tt">index.html</span>, which you can view locally with your Web
browser.  (You can also use a word processors such as Word or WordPad if you
save in "plain text", "text", "text document", or "text document MS-DOS
format".)
<a href="#install">Later</a> I'll explain how you can install your web site on
the Internet.

Once you've made your "home page" (index.html) you can add more pages to
your site, and your home page can link to them.

<h3 id="syntax">2. HTML Syntax</h3>

Web pages are written in Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML).  HTML has three
special characters:
<span class="tt">&lt;</span>, <span class="tt">&amp;</span>, <span class="tt">&gt;</span>.
An HTML command is enclosed in <span class="tt">&lt;...&gt;</span>, for example 
<span class="tt">&lt;p&gt;</span>, which is a paragraph separator, or <span class="tt">&lt;b&gt;</span>
("begin bold") and <span class="tt">&lt;/b&g
